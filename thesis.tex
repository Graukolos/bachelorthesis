\RRLABpreface{Preface}{
    This thesis is a wonderful opportunity to thank the people who've helped me both writing it as well as on my way to it.

    First, I want to thank Prof. Karsten Berns for providing me the opportunity to write about a topic that I am deeply passionate about, that is not a given.
    Second, thanks to my supervisor Oleksandr Sivak, who helped me both with the bachelor thesis and the bachelor seminar.

    To my parents, who have always supported me in every way, I just want to say
    I love with all my heart and I'm proud to be your son.

    There are also quite a few people I would consider mentors who influenced in a big way who I am today.
    While some of them may never read this, I still want to give my thanks to them:
    Harald Pister, Henrik Roes and Clemens Schroeder

\RRLABabstract{Abstract}{
    We present a flexible motor controller on a RaspberryPi.
    We discuss several different approaches to achieve our goals: One running bare metal without an operating system, and another one on top of the linux kernel.
    For the linux kernel version we explore multiple different ways on optimizing the execution times.
    All of these will be written in the Rust programming language, a modern systems programming language with potential in the embedded world.
    This allows for an detailed analysis of Rust's intercompatibility with C.
