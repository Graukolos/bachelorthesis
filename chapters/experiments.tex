% This is the second main part of the thesis. The experiments should be suitable to validate your approach.
% Define the experimental setting, e.g. the robot or the dataset, the metrics as well as the results.
% The visualization of the results should be in a way such that it is easily understandable.
% Usually, first, the results are reported and then the effects of the results on the defined problem are discussed.
% Answer the question, what parts of the problem did you solve?
