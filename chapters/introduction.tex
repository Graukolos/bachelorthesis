\begin{comment}
FPGA expensive, slow and takes long to develop
RaspberryPi cheap and has hardware acceleration for SPI and PWM
Rust as new language competitive to C?
Bare-metal still necessary with modern Microprocessors and Real-time Linux?
What if we want to implement something different from linear control?

Closed loop control not a new problem
better results the higher the control frequency
Can we build a fast control loop while staying on Linux?

\section{Closed Loop Control}
Closed loop control has been implemented in many different ways,
from mechanical structures like a centrifugal governor to specialized integrated circuits.
In this paper we will implement closed loop control of a brushless DC motor on a Raspberry Pi 4.
This effort is part of the larger goal of building a successor to CARL\cite{CARL} at RRLAB.
There are a variety of different ways the motor controllers could be implemented, the old CARL used FPGAs for example.
We chose to use a Raspberry Pi for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cost when compared to a FPGA
    \item 
\end{itemize}
