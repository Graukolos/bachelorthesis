  abstract  = {First created in 2006 by Graydon Hoare as a side project while working at browser-developer Mozilla, headquartered in Mountain View, California, Rust blends the performance of languages such as C++ with friendlier syntax, a focus on code safety and a well-engineered set of tools that simplify development. According to researchers at Microsoft, 70% of the bugs that the company fixes each year relate to memory safety. Stephan HÃ¼gel, who studies the visualization of geographical data at Trinity College Dublin, estimates that he spent two or three months porting a Python algorithm for converting geospatial coordinates from one reference system into another into Rust, achieving fourfold faster execution.},
