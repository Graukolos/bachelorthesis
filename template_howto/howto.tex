% Definition of the document class (rrlab.cls) with optional parameters
% Different document types:
%   Parameter [thesis] To create a master's or bachelor's thesis
%   Parameter [report] To create a report, no "chapter" only "section" can be used to create project or seminar reports etc.
%                      The command \RRLABmaktetitle can be used to create a paper-like header (e.g. for seminar papers).
%                      The use with \RRLABtitlepage and \RRLABpagenumbers is suitable for applications, reports etc.
%   Parameter [diss] Create a dissertation for submission to the department
%   Parameter [summary] To create the summary of the dissertation to inform the faculty that the PhD process has nearly been completed
%   Parameter [dissfinal] Creating a dissertation for submission to the publisher
% Language options:
%   Parameter [de,en] Language, default is [en]
%   Parameter [latin1] sets input encoding to latin1, default is utf8
% Screen presentations:
%   Parameter [colorlinks] recommended for screen presentation; can be used to switch on the colored links when building with 'pdflatex'
%   Parameter [rgbcolor] sets the color coding to RGB (recommended for screen presentation); CMYK is set by default (for printing)
% Misc Options
%   Parameter [external] If your thesis was done externally, you can choose this option and must give the name of the institution with \RRLABinstitution{}
%   Parameter [draft] Omits title page, table of contents, index, etc. and marks overfull boxes
%   Parameter [boldauthor] highlights the author defined in the file 'bold_author.bib' in the bibliography.
%   Parameter [relaxed] allows slightly less attractive spacing for automatic line breaks
%   Parameter [icsecondpage] 'image correction for 2nd page' makes a binding correction for the 2nd page that corresponds to the red cover pages for bachelor and master theses,
%                             This is helpful if you do not want to print the title of the thesis on the cover page
%                             (there is also a template for this), but want to cut out the title field. Then the title
%                             on the 2nd page fits exactly into this window.

% Comment the following commands out depending on your needs

% Generate a title page. The parameter can e.g. be an Image
% or additional text that shows up in the middle of the page
% Additionally the date is forwarded
% For Dissertations: Neither the date nor the title image is needed and therefore not shown
\RRLABtitlepage{An image or something else, usage: e.g.\\ \includegraphics[width=10cm]{rrlab}}{\today}


% Second page with Title, Author, supervisor etc.
\RRLABsecondpage


% Page with the declaration, that the work was done only by yourself
% Parameter is the date when the declaration is signed

% Parameter: 1. Parameter Name of the Chapter, e.g. Preface, Acknowledgement, ...
%            2. Parameter the actual preface
\RRLABpreface{Preface}{In Dissertations usually a Preface is expected.
  These are commonly acknowledgments. For Bachelor and Master theses, it is also common.
  For any smaller work, e.g. project or seminar reports it is not common and not recommended.
  
  Who you acknowledge is up to you. We want to thank Roland Bless
  who wrote the base of the here used this \LaTeX -class}

% Abstract
% Parameter: 1. Parameter Name of the chapter, e.g. Abstract, Summary, ...

\RRLABabstract{Abstract}{This documentation introduces the usage of the \latexklasse. 
It is used as a template for different works and includes helpful information for the creation of scientific documents.}

%% Start of the actual thesis

%% For longer works it is recommended to split the work
%% into individual chapters, each with a different file
%% which are then included in the main file via \include{}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Paper-like header for Seminar/Projects
% \RRLABmaketitle

% Page numbers: Only in report mode, not for seminars
% \RRLABpagenumbers

\include{introduction}

\include{latexclass}

\include{floats}

\include{structure}

\chapter{Another chapter}
\label{chap:addendum}

\section{Why this section and chapter?}
This chapter only exists to highlight, that it is possible
to use a mixture of directly inserted Text and files
that are included via \verb|\include|. For short documents
it might be more feasible to use only a single \LaTeX file,
as it is faster and easier to keep an overview.

%% Bibliography

%% Inclusion of the Bibliography. The macro expects
